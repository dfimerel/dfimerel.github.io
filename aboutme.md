I am currently a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, working actively on identifying genetic changes in breast cancer. I am working at IRIBHM, at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, in Belgium.

## My research interests

I'm specially interested in the following research fields:

* Bioninformatics
* Cancer Genomics

## What do I do when I don't do research

On my free time I mostly play basketball in an amateur team, do some basic cooking or read mystery books
