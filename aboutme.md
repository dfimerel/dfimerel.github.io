subtitle: A little bit about me
---

I am a computational biologist/data scientist with over ten years of experience in academia. I work on genomics and (single-cell) transcriptomics data in cancer research projects. My research experience includes work with a number of leading institutes and universities where I have been participating and leading numerous projects in breast and thyroid cancer. As a member of the Prof. Sotiriou lab in Jules Bordet Institute, I am part of international research consortiums, aiming to identify biomarkers for (metastatic) breast cancer. I use R for data wrangling and visualisation. Outside of my research, I enjoy analysing and visualising different type of data, including aviation and sports-related datasets.


## My research interests

I'm specially interested in the following research fields:

* Bioninformatics
* Cancer Genomics
* Oncology
* Biology
* Data analysis and visualisation


## What do I do when I don't do research

On my free time I play basketball and I run, I practice yoga, do some basic cooking or read mystery books
