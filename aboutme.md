I am currently a bioinformatics post-doctoral fellow at Institut Jules Bordet (in Brussels), working on understanding the biology of breast cancer! I am part of the Breast Cancer Translational Research Laboratory J.C. Heuson, a diverse and exciting group of scientists and medical doctors.


## My research interests

I'm specially interested in the following research fields:

* Bioninformatics
* Cancer Genomics
* Oncology
* Biology


## What do I do when I don't do research

On my free time I play basketball and I run, I practice yoga, do some basic cooking or read mystery books
