I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at IRIBHM of the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, working actively on identifying genetic changes in breast cancer. I have finished my PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the same institute.

## My research interests

I'm specially interested in the following research fields:

* Bioninformatics
* Cancer Genomics
* Oncology
* Biology


## What do I do when I don't do research

On my free time I mostly play basketball in an amateur team, do some basic cooking or read mystery books
